  title "The IIS 8.5 website must use a logging mechanism that is configured to
  allocate log record storage capacity large enough to accommodate the logging
  requirements of the IIS 8.5 website."
  desc  "In order to make certain that the logging mechanism used by the web
  server has sufficient storage capacity in which to write the logs, the logging
  mechanism needs to be able to allocate log record storage capacity.

      The task of allocating log record storage capacity is usually performed
  during initial installation of the logging mechanism. The system administrator
  will usually coordinate the allocation of physical drive space with the web
  server administrator along with the physical location of the partition and
  disk. Refer to NIST SP 800-92 for specific requirements on log rotation and
  storage dependent on the impact of the web server.
